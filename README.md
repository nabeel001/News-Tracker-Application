# News Tracker Application
## Overview

There are multiple news apps available in the market where users are often spammed with irrelevant information. There are also a lot of contexts that are shared which requires the user to go through the entire article to understand the news. This is time-consuming and doesnâ€™t cater to the immediate needs of the user. This News Tracker Application helps users find relevant and important news easily every day from multiple news sources and also get crisp summaries for quick reading.
